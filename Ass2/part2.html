<h1>Assignment 2, Part 2 - Object Oriented JavaScript</h1>

<p>
    This portion of the assignment will explore how objects work in JavaScript.
	It is broken in to several parts:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Play with object literal notation.</li>
<li>Get, iterate over, and delete object properties.</li>
<li>Write a constructor function.</li>
<li>Using the prototype.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Your completed answers go in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block of this
	HTML file.  Look for the spots marked with <code>// EXERCISE</code>.  When
	the assignment is complete, you can submit it via Moodle.
	(See link under Lesson 3).
</p>

<h2>Object Literal Notation</h2>

<p>
	In lecture 3, we discussed how object literal notation works.  For exercise A,
    your mission is to create an object using the literal notation which is equivalent
	to:
</p>

<pre>
	var student = new Object;
	student.name = "fred";
	student['favorite cheese'] = "munster";
	student['test scores'] = new Array;
	student['test scores'].push( 91 );
	student['test scores'].push( 95 );
	student['test scores'].push( 92 );
</pre>

<h2>Property Manipulation</h2>

<p>
	Let's practice manipulating object properties.  Exercises B and C just involve
	accessing existing properties and should require no further explanation.
</p>

<p>
	For Exercises D and E, you need to understand the two types of <code>for</code>
	loops available in JavaScript.  The first is for looping over arrays.
	The second is for looping over properties in an object.
</p>

<pre>
	// loop over an array.  Note that arrays always have a length property set.
	var names = ["Bob", "Fred", "Mindy"];
	for ( var i = 0; i &lt; names.length; ++i ) {
		console.log( names[i] );
	}
</pre>

<pre>
	// loop over properties in an object.
	var student = {"a": 3, "b": 4};
	for ( var propName in student ) {

		// prop name is a string with the property name, which we can feed in
		// the [] operator to get our desired property.
		console.log( propName + " is set to " + student[propName] );
	}
</pre>

<p>
    For Exercise F, you just need the <code>delete</code> operator.  It's really
	simple to use for object properties:
</p>

<pre>
	var student = {"x": true};
	delete student.x;
</pre>

<p>
	For Exercise G, you need the <code>in</code> operator.  Again, it's simple.
	Just remember that the property name needs to be a string, as shown below:
</p>

<pre>
	var student = {"name": "Gertrude"};

	if ( "name" in student ) {
		console.log( "student has a name: " + student.name );
	}
	else {
		console.log( "student is anonymous" );
	}
</pre>

<h2>Constructor Functions</h2>

<p>
	By convention, constructor functions always begin with a capital letter.  They
	are normally used together with the <code>new</code> operator to create objects
	of a given class.
</p>

<p>
	As described in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">
	Mozilla developer documentation</a>, the new operator does three things when invoked on a constructor
	function Foo():
</p>

<ol>
<li>It creates a new object with its prototype set to Foo.prototype.</li>
<li>It calls the constructor function Foo(), with the <code>this</code> variable
    bound to the newly created object.</li>
<li>The object from step 1 is returned from the expression, unless the constructor function
    explicitly returns something else instead.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Here is an example:
</p>

<pre>
	// a constructor function
	function Chevy() {
	    this.brand = "Chevrolet";
		this.model = "Malibu";

		// grab a handle to "this" to permanently bind in function below
		var self = this;
		this.honk = function() { console.log( self.model + " honks!" ); };
	}

	// make an instance of Chevy
	var myChevy = new Chevy;

	// call a member function on our instance
	myChevy.honk();
</pre>

<p>
	For Exercise H, you need to make a constructor function for class Point.
	It takes two arguments, x and y, and sets them in the newly created object.
	Use your constructor function to create an instance of the class with the
	coordinates x=3,y=2.
</p>

<h2>Prototypes</h2>

<p>
	As discussed in the lectures, every JavaScript object has a prototype
	associated with it.  The prototype may either be another object or it may
	be null.  When we access a property in an object, we work our way up the
	prototype chain until we either find said property or run out of prototypes
	to look in.
</p>

<p>
	Prototypes are assigned via the constructor function.  In standards-compliant
	JavaScript, the prototype assignment can't be changed afterwards.  (The the
	prototype object itself can still be manipulated).  Some browsers offer the
	non-standard __proto__ property which gets around this rule.
</p>

<p>
	Here is an example of a prototype.  Note that <code>this</code> works as
	expected.
</p>

<pre>
	// a constructor function
	function Chevy() {
	    this.brand = "Chevrolet";
		this.model = "Malibu";

		// grab a handle to "this" to permanently bind in function below
		var self = this;
		this.honk = function() { console.log( self.model + " honks!" ); };
	}

	// this prototype is assigned to all newly created Chevy instances
	Chevy.prototype = {'honk': function() {console.log( this.model + " honks!" )} };

	// make an instance of Chevy
	var myChevy = new Chevy;
	myChevy.honk();
</pre>

<p>
	For the final Exercise I, create a constructor function called Vector.
	Like the Point for the previous exercise, it should take two arguments,
	x and y, and store these values in the new instance.  In the prototype,
	create a method called vecLength() which computes the Euclidean length of
	the vector.  (Square root of x^2 + y^2).  JavaScript has a built-in
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/sqrt">
	Math</a> object that you can use.
