<h1>Assignment 2, Part 1 - Event Bubbling</h1>

<div id="mainContent">

<p>
	The objective of this assignment is to visualize DOM event bubbling.  
	We want to color the background of each DOM element cyan in the order 
	that the event propagated past it.  The idea being that if we click 
	on a nested element, we'll first see the element turn cyan, then its 
	parent, then its grandparent, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We've covered most of the needed ingredients in class:
</p>

<ul id="ideaList">
<li>jQuery Selectors
	<ul>
	<li>We want to select everything under &lt;body&gt; and bind a click
	    handler that marks which DOM elements saw the event.</li>
	<li>We want to select the &lt;body&gt; tag itself.  It should not only 
	    mark that it saw the event, it should also begin the sequence of DOM 
		element background coloring events.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>jQuery Event Handlers
    <ul>
	<li>We can bind a "click" event handler to each DOM element under body to 
	    mark that an event passed by.</li>
	<li>We can bind a separate click event handler to &lt;body&gt; that begins 
	    the coloring sequence.</li>
	<li>Inside the event handler, the <code>this</code> variable represents the 
	    current DOM element.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Storing lists of visited DOM elements
    <ul>
	<li>In class, we've looked at the jQuery <code>data()</code> function, which 
	    would let you store a list of visited elements somewhere on the DOM.</li>
	<li>You could use a global JavaScript variable by making an array called
	    <code>window.visitedDomElems</code>, or something similar.</li>
	<li>You could experiment with adding a property of the jQuery event object
	    that your click handlers see</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	For animating which DOM elements have been visited, you may use the 
	following code.  (You're also welcome to implement to your own approach).
</p>	
	
<pre>

	/**
	 * Mark which DOM elements have been visited by adding the visitedDomElement 
	 * CSS class for a brief time.
	 *
	 * JavaScript provides the window.setTimeout() function that lets us put a delay 
	 * in the coloring process.  After the timer expires, we recurse and complete the
	 * process if any items remain on the domElems array.
	 *
	 * The Array.slice() method is used to make a deep-copy of our input array, 
	 * minus the first element which we just finished processing.
	 *
	 * @param domElems   An array where the first element is what was clicked.  The 
	 *                   second element is its parent.  The third element is its 
	 *                   grandparent, etc.  The last element should be the body tag.
	 */
	function markVisits( domElems ) {
	
		// color inner-most element
		$(domElems[0]).addClass( 'visitedDomElement' );
		
		// debugging output in the dev console
		console.log( domElems[0].tagName );
		
		// leave coloring around for one second
		var sleepTimeMsec = 1000;
		window.setTimeout(
			function() {
				// uncolor our element
				$(domElems[0]).removeClass( 'visitedDomElement' );
				
				// recurse if additional elements remain
				if ( domElems.length > 1 ) {
					markVisits( domElems.slice( 1 ) );
				}
			},
			sleepTimeMsec
		);
	}
</pre>

<p>
    Your completed implementation go in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block of
    this HTML file.  When the assignment is complete, you can submit it via
    Moodle.  (See link under Lesson 3).
