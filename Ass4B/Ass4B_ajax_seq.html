	<h1>Ajax Sequencing</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
		Ajax does not give any ordering guarantees.  If you make 20 requests in a row,
		the results may come back in any order.  We illustrated this issue in class:
	</p>
	<pre>
  var url = 'http://courses.washington.edu/poswd100/sequence.php?callback=?';

  for ( var i = 0; i &lt; 20; ++i ) {
    $.getJSON( url, {'seq': i},
               function(resp) {
                 console.log( resp.seq );
               } );
  }
  </pre>










	<p>
		To demo the out-of-order effect, the class PHP script added a random sleep
		before emitting a response.  Note that this sleep isn't actually needed to
		cause this behavior.  Normal network and server latencies will also cause
		out-of-sequence responses.  It's just easier to reproduce using the explicit
		randomized sleep.
	</p>

	<div class="probDiv">
		<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
		<p>
			The PHP script has been included with this assignment.  Upload it to your UW
			web account.  For all remaining parts of this assignment, call your copy of
			the script using JSONP requests.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The "Network" tab in the Chrome developer tools can be very handy when trying
		to debug Ajax related problems, including sequencing issues.  It shows you
		exactly what requests are going out and when.  It also shows you when the
		answers come back.
	</p>

	<h2>Callback Chaining</h2>

	<p>
		In class we demonstrated one technique for forcing an ordering on the results.
		We initiated each successive request in the sequence in the result callback of
		the previous request.
	</p>

	<div class="probDiv">
		<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
		<p>
			Implement the callback-based sequencing solution that we demonstrated in
			class.  The code goes in the
			<code>
				callbackChaining()
			</code> stub of this HTML
			file.  Make JSONP requests against your copy of the PHP script and write the
			results to the console.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		While this approach does work, it has the downside of being extremely slow.
		Essentially, you are throwing away any potential parallism in order to enforce
		a serialization on your results.  Take a look at the "Network" tab of the
		Chrome dev tools as your code executes.  You should be able to see the callbacks
		in action.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a useful time to share some vocabulary.
	<p>

	<p>
		<dfn>Throughput</dfn> is the total number of items processed in a period of
		time.  That's pretty abstract!  Here is a concrete example.  For what we're
		doing, we can measure throughput by looking at the processing time for our
		20 api requests.  (20 reqs) / (X seconds total time) = (Y reqs / second).
		Normally the browser tries to increase throughput by downloading multiple
		assets simultaneously.  Our callback technique prevents this behavior, giving
		us the correct answer but a lower throughput.
	</p>

	<p>
		<dfn>Latency</dfn> measures how long it takes to get a response when you make
		a request.  In this example, we measure latency from the time we make an API
		request till the time that the answer is available.  The Network tab in the
		Chrome dev tools shows you latency under in the "Time" column.  In the
		"Timeline", the light part of the bar shows the time between the initial
		request and the first bytes coming back from the server.  The dark part of the
		bar shows data being transferred in.  The length of the bar--both light and
		dark parts--shows the total latency.
	</p>

	<p>
		Throughput and Latency are related but not the same.  Here is one last example
		to help visualize the difference.  If I load up a box truck with data-filled
		thumbdrives and drive from Seattle to Portland, my throughput is massive.
		However, my latency is terrible--it takes hours of driving.  In contrast, I
		can send an SMS to my Portland buddy in just a few seconds.  Much better
		latency, but now my throughput is terrible (hundred or so bytes a message).
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, <dfn>Round-tripping</dfn> in the context of an API means making
		multiple sequential requests.  That's exactly what we're doing in this
		exercise, and it can sometimes be an indicator of poorly written code.
		Sometimes you can rewrite the client to make the requests in parallel as we do
		in the next section.  You can also update the backend API to accept multiple
		requests in a single call, reducing the number of trips over the network.
	<p>

		<h2>Result Inspection</h2>

	<p>
		Rather than wait for a request to complete before firing off the next one, we
		can inspect our results and enforce the ordering constraint there.  So for
		this code, we fire off all the requests at once like we do in the
		<code>
			outOfSeq()
		</code> example in this HTML file.  We ensure that results are
		printed in the proper order by holding on to responses until all predecessors
		have come in.  The pseudo code below explains this idea:
	</p>
	<pre>
  var results = [];
  var maxWritten = -1;

  for ( var i = 0; i &lt; 20; ++i ) {

    // make ajax call and then in callback:
    //
    //  a) store answer in results array
    //
    //  b) check if maxWritten+1 is defined in results array.  If yes, print
    //     it.  If no, callback is done.
    //
    //  c) increment maxWritten, repeat (b) until we hit undefined result or all
    //     20 items have been written out.

  }
  </pre>










	<div class="probDiv">
		<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
		<p>
			Implement the code sketched out above.  Your answer goes in the
			<code>
				resultInspection()
			</code>
			stub of this HTML file.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		This technique works around the throughput limitations of callback chaining.
		Our browser still fires off multiple requests; our answers still write out in
		sequence.  The downsides are the added code complexity and the storage
		requirements for unprocessed AJAX results.
	</p>

	<p>
		Technically, we don't have to hold on to all of the responses.  We really only
		need to store those that have not yet been processed.  After processing, we
		could free up the response for garbage collection, if we were so inclined.
	</p>

	<h2>jQuery Deferreds</h2>

	<p>
		Our final sequencing technique will used jQuery deferred objects.
		Read over the API documentation for <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/">when()</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two preliminaries needed for this final exercise.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, we need to handle the fact that when() does not take an array of
		arguments.  In class we discussed the call() and apply() methods available in
		JavaScript.  We can use apply() to "unwrap" an array of deferred objects and
		pass it in to when().  See this
		<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5627284/">StackOverflow page</a>
		for details.
	</p>

	<p>
		Second, we need to create a callback which handles the result from when().  We
		could write a function which explicitly takes 20 arguments.  Our code would
		then have to poke each and every argument to extract a result.  A better way
		is to use the
		<code>
			arguments
		</code> array which JavaScript sets in every
		function call.  You can use this array to see how many arguments you were
		called with, and to extract the values of those arguments:
	</p>
	<pre>
  function foo() {

    // number of args
    console.log( 'number of args: ' + arguments.length );

    // value of each argument
    for ( var i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; ++i ) {
      console.log( 'arg ' + i + ': ' + arguments[i] );
    }
  }
  </pre>










	<div class="probDiv">
		<h3>Exercise 4</h3>
		<p>
			Write the API responses to the console in sequence using when() and done().
			First, make all your JSONP calls using a loop and store the deferred objects
			in an array.  Pass this array of deferreds to when() by using apply().
			Finally, write a done() callback which loops over all the responses using the
			special JavaScript
			<code>
				arguments
			</code>
			array and prints the answers in
			order.  The code goes in the
			<code>
				jqueryDeferreds()
			</code> stub of this HTML
			file.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		This technique strikes a balance between callback chaining and result
		inspection.  It allows the browser to make multiple simultaneous requests,
		increasing throughput.  However, it must wait for all the requests to complete
		before taking any action, so the perceived latency is higher than the result
		inspection technique.  On the other hand, this code is much simpler than
		manually tracking the results.
	</p>
